For scripts which are called via Fabric, and run Conda first, they may fail with shell issues.

Q 29/12/19: Currently getting this issue for localhost running with Fabric, but not an issue on remote machines - did I already fix this somehow...?

30/12/19: running test sh scripts seems to indicate that problem is not fixed on Jake, although now unclear why notebook processing script works!

Fixes... set Conda paths explicitly.

  >>> This works nicely, deploy...
  (See http://localhost:8888/notebooks/python/epsman/tests/Remote_run_tests_301219.ipynb)
  e.g. with c.prefix(f"source {job.hostDefn[job.host]['condaPath']} ePSproc-v1.2"):
            c.run....
  For env as var:
  with self.c.prefix(f"source {self.hostDefn[self.host]['condaPath']} {self.hostDefn[self.host]['condaEnv']}")
  (See runNotebooks(), submitUploads() for examples)

Fix in script option (implemented on Jake local version, ~/ePS/scripts2019/jr_epsProc_nb.sh )
>>> This is OK, but needs to be set on local machine (although conda dir is standard)

# Set env
source ~/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh  # For conda use set up as per https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/7980
conda activate ePSproc-v1.2

Tested on Bemo: Running code for all users doesn't fix Fabric run issue.

Conda currently prints the following message in this case (v4.5.12, Dec. 2019):


CommandNotFoundError: Your shell has not been properly configured to use 'conda activate'.
If your shell is Bash or a Bourne variant, enable conda for the current user with

    $ echo ". /home/femtolab/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" >> ~/.bashrc

or, for all users, enable conda with

    $ sudo ln -s /home/femtolab/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh /etc/profile.d/conda.sh

The options above will permanently enable the 'conda' command, but they do NOT
put conda's base (root) environment on PATH.  To do so, run

    $ conda activate

in your terminal, or to put the base environment on PATH permanently, run

    $ echo "conda activate" >> ~/.bashrc

Previous to conda 4.4, the recommended way to activate conda was to modify PATH in
your ~/.bashrc file.  You should manually remove the line that looks like

    export PATH="/home/femtolab/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"

^^^ The above line should NO LONGER be in your ~/.bashrc file! ^^^
