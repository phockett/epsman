To build locally...

*FULL REBUILD*
Linux
  From notebook:
    Use epsman.buildSite()
    This assumes Linux host

  From cli:
    From epsman/web run:
      python buildSphinxHTML <path to webroot>
    To rebuild index. Then run
      buildHTML.sh <path to webroot>


Windows:
  <path to webroot. = D:\code\github\ePSdata
  
  From epsman/web run:
    python buildSphinxHTML <path to webroot>
  To rebuild index. Then run Sphinx:
    cd <path to webroot>
    make html

  Then copy or move build/html to docs.

  TODO: Check nbsphinx_prolog (in /source/conf.py), for ePSdata this may not work correctly on Win machines, probably a / vs. \ issue!

*PARTIAL REBUILD*

Run as above, but in a temporary dir... then copy just required files to git repo. In this case side-bar menus between new and old files may become out of sync.

Note: corresponding files from build/html/_images and /_sources may also be required. (Not sure about the latter, but N2O page possibly needed this - unclear!)
